# Lesson 1

Book: Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications without a PhD, 1st Edition.

## What you don't need, to do deep learning

* Just high school math is sufficient.
* We've seen record-breaking results with <50 items of data.
* You can get what you need for state-of-the-art work for free.

## Where is deep learning the best-known approach?

* NLP
* Computer Vision
* Medicine
* Biology
* Image generation
* Recommendation systems
* Playing games
* Robotics
* Other applications

## Neural networks: a brief history

* Deep learning is based on neural network that started in 1943 with Warren McCulloch.

## The first AI Winter

People pointed out that AI models couldn't learn simple functions like XOR, even though the 
limitations could be addressed.

In 1986, Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) was released that described an approach to 
deep learning.

## The age of deep learning

In the 80's, it was mathematically proven that the neural networks could work, but were often
too big and slow. We can now do this. **Deep** learning means **more layers**.

## What you don't need, to do deep learning

* Just high school math is sufficient.
* We've seen record-breaking results with <50 items of data.
* You can get what you need for state-of-the-art work for free.

## Where is deep learning the best-known approach?

* NLP
* Computer Vision
* Medicine
* Biology
* Image generation
* Recommendation systems
* Playing games
* Robotics
* Other applications

## Neural networks: a brief history

* Deep learning is based on neural network that started in 1943 with Warren McCulloch.

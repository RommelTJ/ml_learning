# Lesson 5

## 3 cases that are malicious

1. Feedback loops: When your model is controlling the next round of data you get.
2. Systems implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes.
3. Bias in online ad delivery (racism).

## Data collection in genocides

IBM created computers that facilitated the tasks of the Nazis.

## Unintended consequences

Consider how your tech could be used:
* By trolls, harassers
* By authoritarian governments
* For propaganda or misinformation

## Ethics

The discipline dealing with what is good and bag; a set of moral principles.
* Ethics is not the same as religion, law, social norms, or feelings.
* Ethics is not a fixed set of rules.

Ethics is:
1. Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do.
2. The study and development of one's ethical standards.

## Recourse and Accountability

Common issue: Systems implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes.

Data contains errors:  
* Ex: Auditor found babies in database of California gang members.
* Ex: Credit bureaus found 26% had mistakes in their file.

Technology can be used in unintended ways:
* Facial recognition developed for adults used with children.
* NYPD using facial recognition with pics of Woody Harrelson.
* Abusing confidential databases.

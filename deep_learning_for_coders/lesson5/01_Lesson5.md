# Lesson 5

## 3 cases that are malicious

1. Feedback loops: When your model is controlling the next round of data you get.
2. Systems implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes.
3. Bias in online ad delivery (racism).

## Data collection in genocides

IBM created computers that facilitated the tasks of the Nazis.

## Unintended consequences

Consider how your tech could be used:
* By trolls, harassers
* By authoritarian governments
* For propaganda or misinformation

## Ethics

The discipline dealing with what is good and bag; a set of moral principles.
* Ethics is not the same as religion, law, social norms, or feelings.
* Ethics is not a fixed set of rules.

Ethics is:
1. Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do.
2. The study and development of one's ethical standards.

## Recourse and Accountability

Common issue: Systems implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes.

Data contains errors:  
* Ex: Auditor found babies in database of California gang members.
* Ex: Credit bureaus found 26% had mistakes in their file.

Technology can be used in unintended ways:
* Facial recognition developed for adults used with children.
* NYPD using facial recognition with pics of Woody Harrelson.
* Abusing confidential databases.

## Feedback Loops and Metrics

Overemphasizing metrics leads to:
* Manipulation
* Gaming
* Myopic focus on short-term goals
* Unexpected negative consequences

Much of AI/ML centers on optimizing a metric.

Examples:  
* England implemented metrics to reduce ER wait times
  * Led to cancelling operations or requiring patients to wait in ambulances.
  * Discrepancies by patients and hospital.
* Essay grading software focuses on sentence length, vocabulary, spelling, subject verb agreement.
  * Can't evaluate things like creativity.
  * Gibberish essays score well.
  * Essays from African-American students receive lower grades from computer vs graders.
  * Essays from students memorizing phrases scored higher.

* Any metric is just a proxy for what you truly care about.  
* Our online environments are designed to be addictive.
* The incentives focus on short term metrics.
* The fundamental business model is around manipulating people's behavior and monopolizing their time.

The major tech platforms (unintentionally) incentivize and promote disinformation:  
* Their design and architecture.
* Their recommendation systems.
* Their business models.

Blitzscaling Premise: If a company grows big enough and fast enough, profits will eventually follow.  
* Prioritizes speed over efficiency.
* Risks potentially disastrous defeat.
* Investors annoint winners (as opposed to market forces).

How is speed/hypergrowth related to data ethics?
* Hockey-stick growth requires automation and reliance on metrics.
* Prioritizing speed above all else doesn't leave time to reflect on ethics.
* Problems happen at a large scale.

# Lesson 2

## Classification vs Regression

Classification and regression have very specific meanings.

Our `is_cat` classification function returns True or False. It's a categorization function used for a Classification 
model.

If you wanted to predict how old is a cat, or predict some kind of number, you call that Regression.

In other words: 
- Classification = Predicting from a discrete set of possibilities.
- Regression = Predicts one or more numeric quantities, such as temperature or location.

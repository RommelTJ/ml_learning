# Lesson 6

## Pet Breeds

Continuing on training CNN for computer vision. Training image classifier for breeds of pets.

Please review Cross entropy loss. If confused, review last lesson or `mnist loss` as its similar.

## Model Interpretation

We can use a confusion matrix. 
* Diagonal shows classified correctly.

When you have many classes, a better thing might be to use: 
* `interp.most_confused(min_val=5)`
* Gives you the most incorrect predictions.

## Multi-label classification
## One hot encoding
## Regression
## Embedding
## Collaborative filtering from scratch
## Regularisation (Data augmentation for regression)
